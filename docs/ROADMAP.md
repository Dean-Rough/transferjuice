# Transfer Juice AI-Assisted Development Roadmap (Updated with Pivot)

## Strategic Pivot Summary

**MAJOR CHANGE**: Transfer Juice has pivoted from a Premier League newsletter to a **global football transfer live feed**. This fundamentally changes our technical architecture from article-based to feed-based systems.

**Key Changes:**

- **Live Feed Primary**: Hourly micro-updates instead of 3x daily briefings
- **Global Scope**: All football leagues instead of Premier League only
- **Web-First**: Live feed experience with email summaries (not newsletter-first)
- **Real-time Architecture**: WebSocket/SSE updates, infinite scroll, tag filtering

## Overview

This roadmap provides implementation guidance for the new Transfer Juice live feed architecture. Each phase must achieve 100% test coverage before proceeding. The roadmap integrates AI assistance throughout development while focusing on feed-first user experience.

**Key Principles:**

- **Testing Gates**: 100% coverage required before phase progression
- **AI-First Development**: Specific prompts for each task using role-based AI assistance
- **Quality Validation**: All AI-generated code must be validated and tested
- **Context-Aware Prompting**: Use repository context, existing patterns, and domain knowledge
