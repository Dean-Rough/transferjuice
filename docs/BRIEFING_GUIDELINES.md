# Transfer Briefing Guidelines - Creating Cohesive Reports

## Core Principles from SI Article Analysis

### 1. Narrative Structure
Each briefing should tell a complete story with:
- **Clear headline hook** - State the main development upfront
- **Context paragraph** - Player's current situation and career highlights
- **Historical context** - Previous transfer interest/connections
- **Current developments** - What's happening now and why
- **Future implications** - What this means going forward

### 2. Essential Components for Every Story

#### Player Statistics & Context
- Career duration at current club
- Major achievements (trophies, goals, assists)
- Age and contract status
- Playing style/position specifics
- Market value/transfer fee context

#### Relationship Dynamics
- Previous connections (managers, teammates, clubs)
- Why the link makes sense (or doesn't)
- Player's own perspective (quotes if available)
- Club's perspective and needs

#### Wider Context
- Team's current situation (league position, recent performance)
- Transfer window context (other signings, departures)
- Competition from other clubs
- Financial implications

### 3. Writing Style Guidelines

#### Coherent Flow
- Start with the news hook
- Build context paragraph by paragraph
- Each paragraph should connect logically to the next
- End with what happens next or wider implications

#### Tone & Voice
- Authoritative but accessible
- Include subtle humor where appropriate (like Müller's "won't have fun" quote)
- Balance speculation with facts
- Let quotes do the heavy lifting for personality

#### Supporting Evidence
- Use specific numbers (goals, years, trophies)
- Reference credible sources
- Include relevant quotes that advance the narrative
- Connect to recent matches or performances

### 4. Structural Template

```
1. HEADLINE HOOK (1 sentence)
   - Main development or angle

2. CONTEXT PARAGRAPH (2-3 sentences)
   - Player's current situation
   - Why this matters now

3. CAREER CONTEXT (2-3 sentences)
   - Key achievements/stats
   - Playing style/reputation

4. TRANSFER DYNAMICS (3-4 sentences)
   - Historical connections
   - Current interest level
   - Player/club perspectives

5. WIDER IMPLICATIONS (2-3 sentences)
   - What this means for all parties
   - Other clubs involved
   - Next steps

6. TERRY'S TAKE (1-2 sentences)
   - Sharp observation or humorous angle
   - Must add value, not just repeat
```

### 5. Statistical Integration

Stats should support the narrative, not interrupt it:
- Weave numbers into sentences naturally
- Use comparisons for context (e.g., "worst-ever Premier League season")
- Include relevant timeframes (17-year stay, 35-year-old)
- Balance team and individual achievements

### 6. Multi-Club Dynamics

When multiple clubs are involved:
- Explain why each club is interested
- Compare their situations/needs
- Include competitive context
- Reference other transfer activity

### 7. Quote Integration

- Use quotes to reveal personality
- Let players explain their own thinking
- Include managerial perspectives where relevant
- Ensure quotes advance the story

### 8. Avoiding "Bitty" Content

DON'T:
- List unconnected facts
- Jump between topics without transitions
- Include stats without context
- Write single-sentence paragraphs
- Mix multiple unrelated stories

DO:
- Build each element on the previous one
- Use transitional phrases
- Group related information
- Maintain focus on the central narrative
- Save separate stories for separate briefings

### 9. Example Analysis - Müller Article Success

The SI article works because it:
1. Opens with clear news (Müller admits considering United)
2. Provides career context (17 years, 250 goals, 33 trophies)
3. Explains historical connection (Van Gaal link)
4. Includes personality through quotes
5. Connects to current context (United's poor season, new signings)
6. Ends with future possibilities (MLS, Serie A interest)
