# Transfer Juice Newsletter Implementation Roadmap

**Strategic Goal**: Transform newsletter from 3x daily briefings to a single morning digest featuring fresh Terry commentary on ALL daily transfer activity, optimized for commute/coffee consumption and driving live feed engagement.

**Target Outcome**: Unique, engaging newsletter content that complements (not competes with) the live feed, with integrated monetization opportunities.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Data Pipeline 🏗️

### 1.1 Update Subscriber Schema for Global Scope

**Current Issue**: Subscriber schema only includes Premier League teams and 3x daily frequency options.

**Task**: Expand subscriber schema to support global football scope and simplified frequency.

**Instructions**:

1. Open `/src/lib/validations/subscriber.ts`
2. Replace `PreferredTeamSchema` enum with comprehensive global teams:
   - Premier League (20 teams)
   - La Liga (top 10: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico, etc.)
   - Serie A (top 10: Juventus, Inter, Milan, etc.)
   - Bundesliga (top 8: Bayern, Dortmund, etc.)
   - Ligue 1 (top 6: PSG, Monaco, etc.)
   - Other major clubs (Ajax, Porto, Celtic, etc.)
3. Update `EmailFrequencySchema` to remove 3x daily options:
   - Keep: `'daily'` (morning digest), `'weekly'`, `'major_only'`
   - Remove: `'all'` (was 3x daily)
4. Add new preference fields:
   - `preferredLeagues`: array of league preferences
   - `includeGlobalTransfers`: boolean for non-preferred team coverage
   - `comedyLevel`: enum ('subtle', 'standard', 'maximum') for Terry humor intensity

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Schema validates without errors
- Global team coverage includes 50+ major clubs across 5 leagues
- Frequency options align with new daily digest strategy
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing subscribers

**Instructions**:

1. Create new file: `/src/lib/newsletter/tweet-aggregator.ts`
2. Implement `DailyTweetAggregator` class with methods:
   - `collectDailyTweets()`: Gather all transfer tweets from past 24h
   - `expandSourceList()`: Include beyond ITK accounts (club officials, journalists, etc.)
   - `filterTransferRelevance()`: Use existing classification but with lower threshold
   - `deduplicateContent()`: Remove retweets and similar content
   - `categoryContent()`: Group by transfer type, club, league, etc.
3. Expand source monitoring to include:
   - Club official accounts (50+ major clubs)
   - Tier 2 journalists (local reporters, etc.)
   - Football media accounts (Sky Sports, BBC Sport, etc.)
   - Player agents and representatives
4. Add transfer keyword expansion:
   - Multiple languages: "fichaje", "trasferimento", "transfert", "Transfer"
   - Slang terms: "done deal", "medical", "personal terms", etc.
   - Emoji patterns: ✅🔄⚽📝 commonly used in transfer tweets

**Configuration File**: Create `/src/config/newsletter-sources.ts`

```typescript
export const NEWSLETTER_SOURCES = {
  tier1_itk: [...], // Existing ITK sources
  club_officials: [...], // @ManUtd, @realmadrid, etc.
  tier2_journalists: [...], // Local reporters
  media_accounts: [...], // @SkySports, @BBCSport
  agents: [...], // Known agent accounts
};
```
