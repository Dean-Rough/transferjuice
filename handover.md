# Handover Notes - TransferJuice Live Feed Activation

## Session Summary (June 25, 2025)

Successfully completed Phase 1, Day 1 of the live feed activation roadmap.

### What Was Done

1. **Homepage Transformation**
   - Replaced `ContinuousFeed` with `LiveFeedContainer` in `/src/app/page.tsx`
   - Fixed import to use named export: `import { LiveFeedContainer } from "@/components/feed/LiveFeedContainer"`
   - Verified all component dependencies exist

2. **API Connections Verified**
   - `/api/feed` endpoint exists and is configured
   - `/api/live-feed` SSE endpoint exists and is ready
   - Both endpoints match what LiveFeedContainer expects

3. **Real-time Infrastructure**
   - Created `/api/monitoring/realtime` endpoint for 5-minute updates
   - Added `vercel.json` with cron configuration
   - Installed `eventsource` package for testing

4. **Test Scripts Created**
   - `test-homepage.ts` - Verifies LiveFeedContainer loads
   - `test-feed-api.ts` - Tests feed data endpoint
   - `test-sse-connection.ts` - Tests real-time SSE connection
   - `test-live-feed-activation.md` - Complete testing instructions

### Current State

- **UI**: LiveFeedContainer is connected to homepage but needs dev server running to test
- **Data Flow**: Still using hourly briefing generation (not real-time)
- **Next Phase**: Need to modify content flow for real-time updates

### Critical Next Steps (Day 2)

1. **Step 2.1: Skip Briefing Generation**
   - Modify `/src/lib/twitter/itk-monitor.ts` to save items directly
   - Generate micro-commentary instead of waiting for briefings

2. **Step 2.2: Create Micro-Commentary Generator**
   - Create `/src/lib/ai/terryMicroCommentary.ts`
   - Quick 280-char Terry reactions

3. **Step 2.3: Handle Real-Time Updates**
   - Update LiveFeedContainer to process SSE events
   - Add new items to top of feed

### Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Various errors in test files and briefing generator (not blocking)
2. **Dev Server**: Must be running to test (wasn't running during session)
3. **No Data**: System may have no feed items - run `npm run briefing:generate` to create test data

### Testing Checklist

```bash
# 1. Start server
npm run dev

# 2. Test homepage
npx tsx scripts/test-homepage.ts

# 3. Test API
npx tsx scripts/test-feed-api.ts

# 4. Open browser
# http://localhost:4433
# Check Network tab for /api/live-feed EventStream
```

### Architecture Decision

Following **Option A** from roadmap: Complete live feed pivot
- Activating hidden infrastructure
- Will transform from 3x daily briefings to real-time feed
- Estimated 2-3 days total effort

### Files Modified

1. `/src/app/page.tsx` - Switched to LiveFeedContainer
2. `/src/app/api/monitoring/realtime/route.ts` - Created
3. `/vercel.json` - Created with cron config
4. Various test scripts in `/scripts/`

### Roadmap Progress

- Phase 1, Day 1: âœ… Complete
- Phase 1, Day 2: Ready to start
- Phase 1, Day 3: Not started

**The Terry's assessment:** "We've done the wiring, connected the pipes, and flipped the switches. Now we need to teach it to speak Terry and push updates faster than a desperate journo on deadline day."
